I have been numerically calculating the gravitational interactions of particles over time using python to study the evolution of globular clusters.

I've focused on studying a property known as relaxation time. This is effectively the time taken to reach an equilibrium state, or to remove any memory of the initial orbit of a star in the cluster.

I measured relaxation time for a range of particle masses, and numbers of particles; and fit the data to a model by minimising the value of chi-squared for two different models. One was a theoretical prediction and one was based on the observed results.

I found that given my assumptions of initial conditions, the theoretical models were inaccurate in some respects but my results for certain parameters agreed with theory.

Further research into my initial conditions and the assumptions made will be necessary in order to study the relevance of these results.
